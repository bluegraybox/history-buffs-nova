This is a stub Jekyll site.

A newly-generated Jekyll site requires some extra config and a little tweaking to make it play nice with GitHub pages.
This includes those fixes, so you can start a new Pages project by just copying it and pushing it to a new repo.

You'll want to set the `title` and `description` in `_config.yml`.

And say something about your project in this file (`about.markdown`).
