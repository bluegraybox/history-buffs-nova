Important: The full title of this book is The Fierce Urgency of Now: Lyndon Johnson, Congress, and the Battle for The Great Society. It is by Julian E. Zelizer. Below is a link to a book review.

Unfortunately, we are losing our location at the Teaism - it is closing that location. Let's try the Osteria da Nino in Shirlington and see how it goes -- the food is excellent, you can just order an appetizer or a drink. I expect it will be quiet there on a Monday night. Please note it is not located on Shirlington's main street, but on the street that has the Post Office, around the corner from Carlyle Grand. I will alert the host that we are a book club, so if you don't see us, just ask.

I don't know when Arena Stage's "All The Way" (about LBJ) will end, but it was excellent and I encourage you to go.

I also want to say how much I have enjoyed the Monday night discussion -- in addition to having a lot of great insights, folks in our group are good listeners.
