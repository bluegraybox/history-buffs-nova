It’s not personal, it’s politics in this 2014 Tony Award-winning drama. President Lyndon Baines Johnson had a way about him. He could massage a victory with one hand and sell you down the river with the other, but brokering a deal is like playing with dynamite. With the country still reeling from President Kennedy’s assassination, and a rising tide of bitterness over Civil Rights, it’ll take more than politicking to hold America together — it’ll take red, white and blue-blooded leadership. Go all the way with LBJ, Martin Luther King, J. Edgar Hoover and more in this “beautifully built dramatic piece” (Variety) where the line between compromise and compromising your principles is as sharp as a knife.
