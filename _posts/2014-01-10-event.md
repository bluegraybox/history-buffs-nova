Carving Myths Out of History: Dying Tecumseh

Friday, January 10, 2014, 6pm (Let's meet at 5:45.)

Meet in F Street Lobby, Lecture: McEvoy Auditorium, Free

Description from the museum website:

Sculpture curator Karen Lemmey leads a gallery talk highlighting Ferdinand Pettrich’s sculpture, The Dying Tecumseh. Following her talk, R. David Edmunds, Watson Professor of American History at the University of Texas at Dallas and author of Tecumseh and the Quest for Indian Leadership, joins Lemmey to discuss the Shawnee war chief and the myth and memory of this sculpture, once displayed in the U.S. Capitol. Renée Gokey(Eastern Shawnee/Sac-n-Fox), educator at the National Museum of the American Indian, will read an excerpt from one of Tecumseh’s greatest speeches. The program, originally intended to mark the bicentennial of Tecumseh’s death and celebrate Indigenous Peoples Day, was rescheduled due to the government shutdown in October.

Presented in collaboration with the National Museum of the American Indian.
