Join us at One More Page to welcome back author and journalist Stephen Harding (THE LAST BATTLE, THE LAST CASTAWAY) to share from his new book: DAWN OF INFAMY: A Sunken Ship, a Vanished Crew, and the Final Mystery of Pearl Harbor. Based on years of research, Dawn of Infamy explores both the military and human aspects of the Cynthia Olson story, bringing to life a complex tale of courage, tenacity, hubris, and arrogance in the opening hours of America’s war in the Pacific. This story of the first ship sunk by a Japanese submarine demonstrates the careful planning and remarkable success of the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor.

On December 7, 1941, even as Japanese carrier–launched aircraft flew toward Pearl Harbor, a small American cargo ship chartered by the Army reported that it was under attack from a submarine halfway between Seattle and Honolulu. After that one cryptic message, the humble lumber carrier Cynthia Olson and her crew vanished without a trace, sparking one of the most enduring nautical mysteries of the war. What happened to the ill–fated ship? What happened to her crew? And was she Japan’s first American victim of the Pacific War?

Join us for a fascinating discussion!
