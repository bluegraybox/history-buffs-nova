From Ford's website (www.fords.org):

Ridiculed and disdained for her perceived sense of entitlement, Mary Lincoln sparked more controversy than any First Lady before or since. Set during the weeks following Abraham Lincoln’s assassination at Ford’s Theatre, The Widow Lincoln portrays a very human Mary in the aftermath of her husband’s death as she mourns the post-war life they will never share. Playwright James Still (The Heavens Are Hung In Black) returns with an emotional drama that explores the tenacious attitudes and heartbreaking grief of the maligned “Mrs. President.”

Ford’s Theatre commissioned this world premiere as part of Ford’s 150, a series of events marking the 150th anniversary of Lincoln’s assassination.

Praise for James Still’s The Heavens Are Hung In Black:
“Engrossing! The work invites an audience to a fuller appreciation of the tortured spirit of the man.” –The Washington Post

Recommended for ages 12 and older. Complex language and ideas.
