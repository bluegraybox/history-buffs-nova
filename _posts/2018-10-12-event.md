The Friends of the Arlington Library Book Sale is a semi-annual fundraiser for the library. They have a huge number of books in all genres and topics on sale for modest amounts ($2-$4, mostly). Bring a large and durable bag.

I'll be there when it opens at 10am and probably stay until noon. If people are up for it, we can go for lunch afterwards - there are a number of places nearby.

The sale hours are:
* Thursday, Oct 11th, 5-9pm - Friends of the Library members only (memberships can be bought at the door for $20)
* Friday, Oct 12th, 10am-6pm
* Saturday, Oct 13th, 10am-6pm
* Sunday, Oct 14th, 12pm-6pm - half-price!
