You don't have to have read or finished the book to come!

I didn't realize this was a long book when I posted this. I had only reviewed the beginning of an electronic version. Since it seems to be pretty long I'm revising the plan for this meeting to be a discussion of the beginning of the book.

In case you don't have time to read it, here's a more manageable topic we can also include: something that can be read quickly since the meeting is coming up soon and has a holiday between now and then. Use the link below to review some of the best historical speeches. We can discuss the speeches and if we agree with the list the article's author presents.

Hope to see you there!
