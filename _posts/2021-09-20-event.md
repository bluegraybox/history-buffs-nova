All the Shah's Men: An American Coup and the Roots of Middle East Terror, by Stephen Kinzer

Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/All-Shahs-Men-American-Middle/dp/047018549X/

With a thrilling narrative that sheds much light on recent events, this national bestseller brings to life the 1953 CIA coup in Iran that ousted the countryâ€™s elected prime minister, ushered in a quarter-century of brutal rule under the Shah, and stimulated the rise of Islamic fundamentalism and anti-Americanism in the Middle East. Selected as one of the best books of the year by the Washington Post and The Economist, it now features a new preface by the author on the folly of attacking Iran.
