If you've booked tickets for this evening's Book Discussion by author Nathaniel Philbrick, let's meet up with fellow History Buffs for Happy Hour at the Estate's Tavern. Philbrick's accurate novels are difficult to put down. A few have been produced as films. Tonight's discussion covers his latest: "Valiant Ambition: George Washington, Benedict Arnold, and the Fate of the American Revolution".

Link for details and pre-talk dinner/appetizer discount below. I will be in attendance with my parents this evening so ask our host or bartender for me any time after 5pm.
