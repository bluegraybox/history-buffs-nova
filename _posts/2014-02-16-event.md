You need to purchase your own ticket for this activity. Hopefully there will be enough tickets for all who are interested in attending. I suggest purchasing soon to make sure you can participate, if interested.

The link is below, with instructions in case the link doesn't work.

Go to the Ford's Theater website, select "Plan your visit," "Daytime visits and hours of operation," "February," "Get tickets," (scroll to Feb. 16), "Find tickets," "11:00 with audio."

This will include the museum, Ranger talk in the theater, Petersen House (where Lincoln died) and the Center for Education and Leadership.

Although the ticket cost is $5, once all the service fees are added it ends up being around $12.

I will send information later about how we can meet up. We can also consider lunch afterward. There are plenty of choices there or in nearby Chinatown.
