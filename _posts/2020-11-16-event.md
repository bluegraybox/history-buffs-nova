Our First Revolution: The Remarkable British Upheaval That Inspired America's Founding Fathers, by Michael Barone

Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/Our-First-Revolution-Remarkable-Upheaval/dp/1400097932/

In this exciting work of popular history, Michael Barone brings the story of the Glorious Revolution–an unlikely late-seventeenth-century British uprising–to American readers and reveals that, without it, the American Revolution may never have happened. With a strong narrative drive and unforgettable portraits of kings, queens, and soldiers, Barone takes an episode that has fallen into unjustified obscurity and restores it to the prominence it deserves.
