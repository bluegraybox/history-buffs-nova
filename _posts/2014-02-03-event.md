Did you know that there have been more books written about Abraham Lincoln than anyone else? About 15,000! Select any one of them and we'll discuss Lincoln at our next meeting. NPR recommends, "Battle Cry of Freedom" by McPherson. I may add other recommendations later. You don't have to have finished your book to attend and actually don't have to have read anything. If this meeting is like our others, you'll leave wanting to read many options that members discuss.

Happy President's Day!
