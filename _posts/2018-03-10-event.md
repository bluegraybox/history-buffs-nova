At this free seminar, we will learn how to edit Wikipedia entries. Wikipedia is the internet's free encyclopedia which is entirely created and maintained by volunteers. The focus will be on women's biographies. Free lunch. I love Wikipedia and have always wanted to learn how to create and edit entries on topics of interest. https://arlingtonva.libcal.com/event/3810049?f=h

Although this is free, including lunch, you must register in advance.
