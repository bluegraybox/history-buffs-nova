In preparation for our April 7 discussion of Frederick Douglass autobiography, let's tour his house the day before. Depending on interest, maybe we can carpool there or else meet there. There is a tour at 12:15 and we have to be there a little before to pick up tickets. They recommend reserving tickets ahead of time (only $1.50) for the house tour or risk-takers can get them there. If they happen to run out, the Visitor's Center is free. The tour is a half-hour. I'll check in with all who RSVPs "yes" about the details and logistics. Here's the website:
