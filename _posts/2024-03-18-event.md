The Age of Revolution: 1789-1848, by Eric Hobsbawm ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Age-Revolution-1789-1848-Eric-Hobsbawm/dp/0679772537/))

This magisterial volume follows the death of ancient traditions, the triumph of new classes, and the emergence of new technologies, sciences, and ideologies, with vast intellectual daring and aphoristic elegance. Part of Eric Hobsbawm's epic four-volume history of the modern world, along with The Age of Capitalism, The Age of Empire, and The Age of Extremes.
