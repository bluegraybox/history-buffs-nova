In celebration of its 75th anniversary, the Department of Interior's Indian Craft Shop will be open to the public on Friday, November 15, 2013. This is a great opportunity to see the famous basement cafeteria murals done by Kiowa Five artists James Auchiah ("Harvest Dance" 1939) and Stephen Mopope ("Ceremonial Dance" 1939).

In addition, we can take a look at a few of the other sculptures and murals near the cafeteria and also by the first floor Indian Craft Shop.

Then we can go into the shop, where there are beautiful wall murals by Allan Houser (Buffalo Hunt) and Gerald Nailor (Deer Stalking). Also, there will be Native American artists there who are selling their art.

Meet at the entrance to the Dept of Interior on C Street at 18th, NW at 12:30 PM.

This is a federal building and you must present a photo ID and pass through the metal detector.
