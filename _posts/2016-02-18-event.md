Evan Thomas (author of Ike's Bluff and Sea of Thunder) will talk about his book Being Nixon: A Man Divided and answer questions at One More Page Books in Arlington, VA. Being Nixon was named one of the ten best Non-fiction books of 2015 by Time Magazine. Should be great discussion! Short notice, but if at least 5 of us show up, they'll open wine for us! One More Page is a few blocks away from East Falls Church metro stop (orange & silver lines).
