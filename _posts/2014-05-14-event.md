This is a talk by the author of the book, "Frederick Douglass in Washington, DC: The Lion of Anacostia." Depending on interest the group can consider meeting before or after the talk also. There is a possibility I will be out of town for this event but thought I would post it for those interested and will let you know my status as it gets closer.
