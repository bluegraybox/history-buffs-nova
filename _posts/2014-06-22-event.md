Please join us for a free book signing and lecture from Dr. J.D. "Jill" Zahniser, the author of "Alice Paul, Claiming Power." She will discuss the life of the suffragist leader and women's rights pioneer. The Oxford University Press says her newly-released biography..."of Paul's early years and suffrage leadership offers fresh insight into her private persona and public image."

Please invite your friends and neighbors to this free event.

The Turning Point Suffragist Memorial Association, sponsor of the event, wishes to thank you for your support in raising funds to build a national suffragist memorial.

Efforts are underway to build a national suffragist memorial at the Occoquan Regional Park in Lorton, Va., that will honor the suffragists whose harsh imprisonment at the Occoquan Workhouse in 1917 served as a “turning point” in winning the right to vote for American women.

Directions:

Armstrong Street is between Chain Bridge Rd. (Rt.# 123) and University Dr. Enter through the Atrium at the rear of the building facing George Mason Blvd. It is an accessible building with ample parking.

Hosted by the City of Fairfax Commission for Women.
