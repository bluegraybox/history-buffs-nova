Taking up the suggestions of a couple of our group members, here is January's discussion topic. One member suggested selections from audible.com and some other members suggested reading something about John Wilkes Booth. Here is about a 2.5 hour audio book about John Wilkes Booth that will, hopefully, be short enough to be completed during the holiday season. Use the link below.

I haven't used audible.com yet but they seem to offer a freebie for the first book so let's take advantage:

http://www.audible.com/pd/History/The-Life-Crime-and-Capture-of-John-Wilkes-Booth-Audiobook/B0036GRGJ8/ref=a_search_c4_1_4_srTtl?qid=1384780582&sr=1-4

Or just come and we'll discuss John Wilkes Booth in general.
