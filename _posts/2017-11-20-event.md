No, I'm not leading a tour to Cuba! Just posting a group tour I am going on. See above link. Flights (not included in tour price) from Washington Reagan were surprisingly inexpensive (round trip to Havana, changing in Atlanta, was $400); but prices change, so call Delta. Again, I'm not "organizing" this, just letting you know about the opportunity!
